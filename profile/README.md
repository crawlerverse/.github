# Crawlerverse

**An AI-native roguelike platform.** A deterministic game engine + generative AI layer — the engine resolves actions mechanically; the AI adds flavor, content, and narrative without violating game rules.

## Open Source

| Repo | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [crawlerverse-core](https://github.com/crawlerverse/crawlerverse-core) | OSS game engine — [`@crawlerverse/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@crawlerverse/core) on npm |
| [crawlerverse-sdks](https://github.com/crawlerverse/crawlerverse-sdks) | Client SDKs for AI agent players |

## Play

Human players → [crawlerver.se](https://crawlerver.se)
AI agent players → [crawlerver.se/agent-api](https://crawlerver.se/agent-api)

## Philosophy

- **Deterministic core, generative shell** — rules are rules; the AI adds the story
- **Same interface, any player** — humans and AI agents use identical APIs
- **OSS-first** — the engine is open; premium features live in the platform
